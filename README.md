## Context
Empirical research in Requirements Engineering (RE) has become an important topic and research area. Over the years, several researchers examined how empirical research in RE is "currently" conducted and how it should be conducted in the future by presenting snapshots of the "current" state of empirical research in RE and, more generally, in Software Engineering (SE). These researchers share the same goal of synthesizing a comprehensive, current, and long-term available overview of the state and evolution of empirical research in RE and SE. Although they share the same goal, use similar methods, i.e., (systematic) literature reviews or systematic mapping studies, and even examine overlapping periods, venues, and themes, they have not collaborated to build on and update previous work. **Lack of collaboration and updating are known challenges of literature reviews.** Overcoming these challenges is critical to ensure the quality, reliability, and timeliness of research findings from literature reviews.

## Motivation
Current research addresses the above challenges by focusing on when and how to update (systematic) literature reviews in SE and its subfields. While these works provide social and economic decision support and guidance for updating literature reviews, **the central problem is the unavailability of the extracted and analyzed data**, corresponding to open science in SE. Unavailable data complicates collaboration among researchers in updating a literature review as the entire data collection, extraction, and analysis must be repeated and expanded for a comprehensive review. Researchers need adequate technical support in the form of infrastructures and services to achieve sustainable literature reviews with all available data. These infrastructures must ensure that the data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) over the long term following the FAIR data principles. For this purpose, the data must be organized in a flexible, fine-grained, context-sensitive, and semantic representation to be understandable, processable, and useful to humans and machines. Over the last decade, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) became an emerging technology in industry and academia as they enable this versatile data representation. Besides well-known KGs for encyclopedic and factual data, such as [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/) and [WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org), using so-called Research Knowledge Graphs (RKGs) for scientific data is a rather new approach. RKGs include bibliographic metadata, e.g., titles, authors, and venues, as well as scientific data, e.g., research designs, methods, and results. They are a promising technology to sustainably organize scientific data, e.g., extracted and analyzed data of literature reviews, as a body of knowledge that can be built, published, maintained, (re)used, updated, and expanded in a long-term and collaborative manner.

## Objective
**Our longterm objective is to develop a body of knowledge that synthesizes a comprehensive, current, and long-term available overview of the state and evolution of empirical research in RE**. For this purpose, we start to explore using RKGs as technical infrastructure for building, publishing, (re)using, updating, and expanding an initial body of knowledge of empirical research in RE (EmpiRE), that the research community can maintain by *dividing* the efforts to *conquer* the EmpiRE. In particular, we explore using the Open Research Knowledge Graph ([ORKG](https://orkg.org/)), a cross-domain and cross-topic RKG that provides accompanying services using intertwined human and machine intelligence by combining manual crowdsourcing and automated approaches to organize scientific data. With this work, we lay the foundation for such a comprehensive, current, and long-term available overview of the state and evolution of empirical research in RE by building, publishing, and evaluating an initial informed and reflected body of knowledge of empirical research in RE.

    <em>Research approach for developing, publishing, and evaluating an intial informed and reflected body of knowledge of empirical research in RE.</em>
</p>

Our research approach consists of three steps: Data collection, Data extraction, and Data analysis. So far, **we collected 411 papers** published in the research track of the [IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000630/all-proceedings) from 2006 to 2022. **We extracted and organized their scientific data**, i.a., research paradigm, research design, empirical method (data collection and data analysis), and bibliographic metadata using a developed [ORKG template](https://orkg.org/template/R186491). ORKG templates allow specifying the structure of descriptions of papers similar to SHACL shapes. In this way, we determined which data should be extracted and ensured that all the descriptions of papers are consistent and comparable to **build and publish an initial informed and reflected body of knowledge of empirical research in RE**.

In this Jupyter Notebook, we perform the data analysis of the developed body of knowledge of empirical research in RE, which has two purposes:

(1) We want to evaluate the body of knowledge concerning its coverage of the curated topic.

(2) We want to get first insights into the state and evolution of empirical research in RE by analyzing the developed body of knowledge.

The data analysis is based on competency questions regarding empirical research in all fields of SE, including RE, derived from the vision of [Sjøberg et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1109/FOSE.2007.30). [Sjøberg et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1109/FOSE.2007.30) describe their vision of the role of empirical methods in all fields of SE, including RE, for the current period of 2020 – 2025 by comparing the **"current" state of practice (2007)** with their **target state (2020 - 2025)**. We analyzed these descriptions and derived a total of [77 competency questions](competency-questions.xlsx). For each competency question, we assessed whether we can answer the question with the developed body of knowledge. Subsequently, we specified the answerable competency questions as [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) queries to retrieve and analyze the data from the [ORKG](https://orkg.org/). In this way, **we obtain answers to the competency questions and thus gain first insights into the state and evolution of empirical research in RE**.
